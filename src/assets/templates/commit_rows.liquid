{% comment %}
  HTML fragment for commit rows. Intended to be injected into an existing <tbody>
  by replacing a placeholder <tr id="...-frag"> via JS.

  Expects:
  - owner, repo
  - commits: array of commit view models used in the commits page
  - compact (optional): render compact sub-rows if true
{% endcomment %}
{% if commits and commits.size > 0 %}
  {% for commit in commits %}
    {% render 'commit_row',
      owner: owner,
      repo: repo,
      commit: commit,
      compact: compact,
      mergeOf: mergeOf
    %}
  {% endfor %}
{% else %}
  <tr
    class="merge-contents merge-empty"
    {% if mergeOf %}
      data-merge-of="{{ mergeOf }}"
    {% endif %}
  >
    <td colspan="4" class="muted">(No commits to show for this merge yet)</td>
  </tr>
