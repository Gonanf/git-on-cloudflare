# Data Flows

This document describes the primary data flows of the server: pushing (receive-pack), fetching (upload-pack), and the Web UI blob views.

## Push (git-receive-pack)

1. Client sends `POST /:owner/:repo/git-receive-pack` (Smart HTTP v0 style body)
2. Worker forwards the raw body to the repository DO: `POST https://do/receive`
3. DO `receivePack()`:
   - Parses pkt-line commands and the packfile payload
   - Writes the `.pack` to R2 under `do/<id>/objects/pack/pack-<ts>.pack`
   - Performs a fast index-only step to produce `.idx` in R2
   - Queues unpack work; the DO `alarm()` processes objects in small time-budgeted chunks and mirrors loose objects to R2 as it goes
   - Validates and atomically updates refs if all commands are valid
   - Returns a pkt-line `report-status` response

Concurrency: relies on Durable Object single-threaded execution; no explicit push lock is required.

The DO also records metadata to help fetch:

- `lastPackKey` and `lastPackOids`
- `packList` (recent packs)
- `packOids:<packKey>` oids per pack

## Fetch (git-upload-pack v2)

1. Client sends capability advertisement request: `GET /:owner/:repo/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack`
2. For `POST /:owner/:repo/git-upload-pack` with a v2 body:
   - `ls-refs` command: reads DO `/head` and `/refs` and responds with HEAD + refs
   - `fetch` command:
     - Parses wants/haves and computes a minimal closure of needed oids
     - Tries to assemble a minimal pack from R2 using `.idx` range reads
       - Single-pack: `assemblePackFromR2()`
       - Multi-pack union: `assemblePackFromMultiplePacks()`
     - If packs canâ€™t fully cover, falls back to DO loose objects and builds a minimal pack on the fly
     - Responds with sidebanded `packfile` chunks

## Web UI blob views

- `GET /:owner/:repo/blob?ref=...&path=...` (preview)
  - Resolves path to an oid via DO reads
  - Uses `HEAD` against DO `/obj/<oid>` to get size (no body)
  - If the file is "too large" (configurable threshold), shows a friendly message and links to raw
  - If not too large, fetches the object and renders text (with simple binary detection)

- `GET /:owner/:repo/raw?oid=...&name=...` (raw)
  - Streams the object by piping the compressed DO response through a decompression stream
  - Uses `Content-Disposition: inline` by default (add `&download=1` to force attachment)
  - Uses `text/plain; charset=utf-8` for safety (prevents HTML/JS execution)
